# Engine Breakdown Analysis Project: 
The main goals of the project were 1) to find patterns and make analytical and/or statistical statements based on the data and 2) to identify the attributes which would be relevant for forecasting the risk of a breakdown and which models would suit the task.
By examining various attributes of engine performance and maintenance, I developed Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifier models that achieved the highest prediction accuracy of 93.9%. These models enable proactive maintenance strategies to reduce downtime and improve engine reliability.
